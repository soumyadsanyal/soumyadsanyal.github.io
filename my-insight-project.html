                </h2>

                <p>In the next set of posts, I'm going to introduce my Insight project.</p>
<p>In response to <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jakeklamka">Jake Klamka's</a> suggestion that we try to work on something that we feel would be impactful, I gave some thought during the first week of Insight to the question of the healthcare market in the United States.</p>
<p>This was far from being the first time that I'd had to think about this question. As an undergraduate, I remember reading a comparative analysis of healthcare expenditure in OECD countries, in which the point was made that the U.S. led the OECD in healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP, but was far from leading OECD countries in terms of allocation efficiency.</p>
<p>Since the ACA was passed, I've been quite interested to read economic policy papers and blogs covering the healthcare market. One that I've found quite interesting is <a href="http://www.theincidentaleconomist.com">The Incidental Economist</a>. (This is not an endorsement of TIE bloggers' conclusions, views, or anything else.) </p>
<p>The primary market failure I've been interested in for a while is the lack of pricing transparency in healthcare. Anyone who's tried to get an estimate or quote from a hospital for a visit, test or procedure <em>before</em> said visit, test or procedure will be acutely aware of how frustrating this exercise is. Many people have found that asking for this information almost always nets you at best an evasive answer along the lines of ''it depends on a million things, just come by and we'll send you a bill later'', or at worst an outright refusal to answer the question. The uncertainty introduced by the combination of this behavior, and the tremendous and variable markups on healthcare services make for poor allocative efficiency, I think. In plain English, it's not good business.</p>
<p>Questions I wanted to answer, therefore, included: what drives prices in the healthcare market? Is there a way to predict ahead of time what a person can expect to be billed for healthcare services over a year? What explains the variation in billed charges for healthcare between different people and different providers? Is there a way to provide this information to consumers to enable them to make better choices when it comes to their provider, treatment or lifestyle?</p>
<p>My initial goal for my Insight project was a bit ambitious: I wanted to build an application for consumers to explore what their billed charges for healthcare would be over the next year. A natural application of these insights would be to help consumers compare health insurance plans. </p>
<p>Over the next few posts, I'll outline how I went about doing this.</p>
