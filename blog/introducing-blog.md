Title: Introducing this blog
Date: 2015-12-20 06:54

I've set up this blog in order to encourage me to write on research topics that I'm interested in, and on projects that I'm currently doing. 

I've found in the past that teaching has been a great way of learning new things well. This blog is a way to force me to reason through and explain what I'm working on in ways that are clear, detailed and that relate to concrete project goals.
