Title: Introducing Insight
Date: 2015-12-20 09:20


In September of this year, I took a leave of absence to do the [Insight Data Science](http://www.insightdatascience.com) program in New York City. Insight is a postdoctoral program that helps Fellows to transition from academia to doing data science in industry.

I can't say enough good things about the Insight program, but let me at least offer a few impressions.

The minimum requirements to enter include a Ph.D., and the program tends to accept applicants who are already well prepared to be data scientists (perhaps 90-95% of the way there), and polishes them for the last mile of the transition. The program is fairly selective; we were told that for the September session, Insight received over 900 applicants, and accepted about 70 people. While this is certainly not to say that people who don't make it into Insight aren't awesome, the selectiveness does ensure a talented cohort, and my fellow Fellows (this term being a running pun throughout the program) were one of the best things about the program. 

Once in the program, Fellows take a week or so to decide on what they'll do for their Insight project, which is a data science project that they'll showcase to mentoring companies towards the end of the program. We're encouraged to try working on something that is do-able in a 2-3 week timeframe, but that is also impactful in some way. There is also the option to do one of a handful of consulting projects, which consist of well defined projects that real, existing startup companies need to get done, but don't have the manpower or funding to implement.

We then spend the next 2-3 weeks implementing our chosen projects in 1 week iterations (affectionately called MVP's - as used in agile development and popularized by Eric Ries). Not all of our time is available for developing our projects; during this period we are visited by a lot of mentor companies that are interested in telling us about themselves, and what they do with data scientists. I think I slept an average of 4 hours a night during these weeks, and I definitely pulled a couple of all-nighters.

In the final phase of the program, we pivot to demo-ing at mentor companies, as well as prepping for the interview stack that most companies have for data scientists. We've been informed that that the bar for admission to be a practicing data scientist in industry has risen recently, and that the interview loops have become more rigorous and demanding at a lot of companies. This makes a lot of sense: with [competitor programs](http://www.thedataincubator.com) setting up shop, there's been an increase in the supply of candidates like us into the data scientist market. The rapid creation of [other bootcamps](http://www.skilledup.com/articles/list-data-science-bootcamps) has also increased the supply of data scientists with different, including non-Ph.D., backgrounds. Finally, the emergence of many university-based data science and analytics masters programs (here's [one](http://bit.ly/1TapxRa) example close to home that I've helped to build) promises to channel yet more talent into the marketplace.

Challenge accepted.
