Title: Math 1300
status: hidden


This page links to teaching materials I provided for my students in Finite Mathematics, taught in Fall 2013 in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.missouri.edu) at [The University of Missouri](http://www.missouri.edu). These materials were written to supplement my lectures, to answer specific questions from students, and to provide solutions to selected assessments. 

The page itself was not available to students during the course. I constructed it afterwards to serve as a summative course portfolio. </p>
