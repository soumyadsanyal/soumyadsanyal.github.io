Title: Math 1400

This page links to teaching materials I provided for my students in "Calculus for Social and Natural Sciences I", taught in Fall 2011 in the [ Department of Mathematics ][2] at [ The University of Missouri.][3]

These materials were written to supplement my lectures and to answer specific questions from students.

The page itself was not available to students during the course. I constructed it afterwards to serve as a summative course portfolio.
