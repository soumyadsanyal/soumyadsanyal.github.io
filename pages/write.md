1. [Irrational Behavior of Algebraic Discrete Valuations](http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1311.6047) (to appear in Journal of Algebra)

 We study algebraic discrete valuations dominating normal local domains of dimension two. We construct a family of examples to show that the Hilbert-Samuel function of the associated graded ring of the valuation can fail to be asymptotically of the form: quasi-polynomial plus a bounded function. We also show that the associated multiplicity can be irrational, or even transcendental.
