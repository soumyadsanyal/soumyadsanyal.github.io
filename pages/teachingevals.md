##Teaching statement 

My statement of teaching philosophy is available [here](../pdf/soumya-sanyal-teaching-statement-20131113.pdf).

##Teaching Award

In 2011-2012 I was awarded an [Excellence in Teaching Award](https://www.math.missouri.edu/grad/graduate-students-awards-mathematics-distinguished-teaching-awards) in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Missouri. This award is made annually by the Excellence in Teaching Committee consisting of faculty in the Department of Mathematics.


## TA Mentoring

During 2013-2014 I was a TA Mentor in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.missouri.edu) at [The University of Missouri](http://www.missouri.edu). This was a funded position in which my duties included mentoring, and observing and assessing the teaching progress of, four incoming graduate teaching assistants.

Additionally, I co-led some sessions of the TA workshop, held August 6-9 2013. I served on the graduate student panel, and with [Luiza DeSouza](https://www.math.missouri.edu/people/desouza), I put together an hour long session on "Cultural Differences", aimed at helping bring international TAs up to speed on teaching at MU, as well as helping domestic TAs better understand international students in their classes. 

My supervisor in this role was [Teri Christiansen](https://www.math.missouri.edu/people/christiansent), who has also been my teaching mentor!
