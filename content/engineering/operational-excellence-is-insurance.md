1. Assume that the objective of your business is to maximize its valuation. 
2. Your valuation is the net present value (discounted) of future profits received per month. Assume that future monthly profits depend on (a) the number of active customers you have each month, multiplied by (b) their average order value per month.
2. Assume that an engineering system `S` is a necessary ingredient to generating those future cash flows. (_If it's not, you probably want to outsource engineering._)
3. Then, engineering quality standards constitute an insurance policy protecting the value of the business.

    3. `S` is scalable in the number of changes: you are cost effective
