Context: I delivered a data platform migration in 2022. This had been previously attempted at my organization, but had not been successful. This gave me some insight into the architecture of the migration that made it possible to succeed, even with fewer resources. I realized that the best migrations are TRIPs. That is,

1. testable,
2. reversible,
3. incremental, and
4. programmatic.
