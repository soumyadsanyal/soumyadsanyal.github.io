                <h5 id="or-what-this-blog-is-about.">Or, what this blog is about.</h5>
<p>It’s not always easy finding a common thread between diverse interests, especially when you learn new things over time and your interests evolve.</p>
<p>Which is another way of saying that I’m still figuring out what this blog is really about, and what its range should be.</p>
<p>But for the moment, I think I’ve settled on the thread of <em>examples and counterexamples</em>.</p>
<p>What makes examples and counterexamples so helpful, and sometimes so beautiful?</p>
<p>A good example can often contain the germ of a really good idea, illustrating it in a very concrete, accessible way. It helps to record the idea’s motivating examples, even if the resulting theory becomes very general and abstract in the end.</p>
<p>A good example, when as simple and succinct as possible, feels like carrying around a really rare gem of an idea in your pocket at all times. It’s a powerful, lightweight addition to your problem-solving superpowers. Like playing a knight in a game of chess, a good example illustrates surprisingly many facts, and clarifies your thinking about unexpectedly many ideas and analogies.</p>
<p>A good set of examples pertaining to an idea serves to show you in precisely what situations an idea will be valid. They demonstrate the idea’s <em>range</em> in simple, memorable and powerful ways.</p>
<p>A good set of counterexamples serves to draw bright lines around your idea, showing you in which situations your ideas will <em>not</em> apply, where you should feel confident that this terrain is <em>different</em>, and needs genuinely new techniques. They protect you from generalizing incorrectly, and keep you from fooling yourself into believing that you’re smarter than you actually are. They help you clearly understand the difference between what you know and what you don’t know.</p>
<p>Between math, computer science, data science and engineering, statistics, and politics, examples and counterexamples, especially when simple, constructive and concrete, have always packed the greatest bang for the buck for me.</p>
<p><em>Examples and counterexamples</em> will probably be the common thread between most of my posts on this blog.</p>
